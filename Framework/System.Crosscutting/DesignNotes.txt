系统依赖接口定义程序集
-----------------------
Because of that, we want to explain the features it addresses so you can take into account why its design is done following this specific way.
1.- We wanted that the 'Mappings definition' from one type to other could be an independend element, a class easy to find 
and use, with no direct dependency to any framework (like emitmapper or automapper). That feature was address by TypeMapConfigurationBase, 
because deriving from it and implementing the BeforeMap, Map y AfterMap methods we'll be able to define tha mapping for each types pair.
For quick mappings, like what it is done within Testing methods, we have TypeMapConfiguration which using delegates allows to stablish mappings in an easy way.
2.- We wanted to favor working for different MODULES (usually one BOUNDED-CONTEXT can have several MODULES). 
Like Eric.E states, MODULES' main purpose is 'code partition' and better organization, most of all.
Therefore, each MODULE can have its mappings assembly in a independent manner from the rest of MODULES.
In order to do so, RegisterTypeMap allows, in a simple way, to define a MODULE's mappings. 
Every instance of that class will be injected automatically like a Service Collection, within TypeAdapter.
